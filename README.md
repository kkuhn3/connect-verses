# Connect Verses

A Javascript implementation of Connect X with a twist. 

## Description

As a test for competitive-ness of predictions. This connect-X has both players make a move at the same time, and then evaluate the outcome. This forces players to make a prediction regarding what the opponent is going to make. Unfortunately connect four is small enough scope where this added prediction doesn't make the game feel better.
